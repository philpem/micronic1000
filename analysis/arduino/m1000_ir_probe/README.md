# M1000 IR probe

This sketch targets an Elegoo Uno R3 (`arduino:avr:uno`). Build it with the
Arduino CLI or IDE and open the serial monitor at **115200 baud**.

The pin assignments are defined at the top of the sketch:

| Signal | Uno pin | Direction |
|---|---:|---|
| `CLK_IN` | D2 | handheld clock input / interrupt |
| `DAT_IN` | D4 | handheld data input |
| `CLK_OUT` | D5 | physical return channel A; proposed clock |
| `DAT_OUT` | D6 | physical return channel B; proposed data |

**Receive conventions remain unconfirmed (owner clarification, 2026-09-22).**
The Arduino LED assignment to handheld clock/data receivers is unknown.
`CLK_OUT`/`DAT_OUT` name software roles, not established optical destinations;
both assignments need testing. `7Eh` as a receive flag is **SUSPECTED**.
These assumptions must remain adjustable on the Arduino, so testing them
does not require another handheld EPROM burn.

The input lines must be protected from the handheld voltage as described in
the sketch comments. The output channels should remain optically separated.

The checked-in default is `RX_NARROW=1`, with `RX_NARROW_AXIS=2`. It sends a
reply to each completed handheld burst using candidate flag `7Eh`, baseline polarity and
phase `-2/8` (data rise 30 us before clock rise), while varying the content
axis. The three content trials are flag only, flag plus `03h`, and an open
type-2 control acknowledgement. The startup banner and each burst line state
the active settings; the per-burst `payload=` field is the logical payload
bytes actually passed to the wire builder.

Other modes are compile-time flags in the sketch (`LISTEN_ONLY`, `LOOPBACK_TEST`,
`PULSE_TEST`, `FREERUN_TEST`, `LADDER_TEST`, `RX_SWEEP`, `FREE_TX`, and related
axes). They are mutually checked with preprocessor errors. Set
`RX_NARROW=0` when enabling another mode. `LISTEN_ONLY=1` is the safe monitor
configuration and does not drive the return outputs.

The emitter defines phase as data-rise minus clock-rise and schedules absolute
timestamps on an eighth-cell grid. `emit_late_max` in a burst report is the
largest `micros()` deadline lateness observed while dispatching that emitted
burst. It measures software deadline lateness only; it does not measure LED,
detector, wiring, interrupt or scope timing, and a zero value is not a physical
waveform guarantee. The host event test is an ideal scheduler check. Confirm
the actual waveform and electrical levels with an independent scope.

The host-only emitter harness is outside this directory at
`analysis/test_ir_emitter.cpp`; keeping it outside the sketch directory avoids
Arduino builders compiling its mock API and `main()` as sketch sources.
